# Overview

## Software Description

This is a Kotlin-based Task Manager application that runs in the console. It allows users to add, view, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Each task has an ID, name, description, and a completed status. The application maintains a list of tasks in memory using Kotlinâ€™s MutableList.


## Purpose

The purpose of writing this software is to gain practical experience with the Kotlin programming language. This project helped me understand Kotlin syntax, data classes, mutable lists, loops, conditional statements, and functions. It also gave me a better understanding of how to build interactive console-based applications and manage user input and program state.
